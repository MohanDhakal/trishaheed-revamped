  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/logo.png
    - assets/images/paper-airplane.png
    - assets/images/telephone.png
    - assets/images/event_banner.png
    - assets/images/contacts/head_sir.jpg
    - assets/images/profile.jpg
    - assets/images/placholder.jpg
    - assets/images/icons/graph.png
    - assets/images/icons/microscope.png
    - assets/images/icons/reading-book.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: OpenSans
  #     fonts:
    #     - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-Regular.ttf
    #       weight: 500
    #     - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-Bold.ttf
    #       weight: 700
    #     - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-Italic.ttf
    #       style: italic          
    #     - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-BoldItalic.ttf
    #       style: italic
    #       weight: 700
    #     - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-ExtraBold.ttf
    #     - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-ExtraBoldItalic.ttf
    #     - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-Light.ttf
    #       weight: 300
    #     - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-LightItalic.ttf
    #       weight: 200
    #     - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-Semibold.ttf
    #       weight: 600
